### Catching Crypto Trends: A Tactical Approach for Bitcoin and Altcoins

This paper explores the application of well-established trend-following methodologies, traditionally used in conventional asset classes, to the cryptocurrency market. It focuses on Bitcoin and extends the analysis to a broader set of liquid digital assets. The research backtests and evaluates classic trend-following approaches, constructing a base model as an ensemble of short and long-term trend signals to capture various momentum and trend dynamics across different time horizons.

**Key Findings:**
- Trend-following strategies can be successfully applied to cryptocurrencies, capitalizing on sustained price trends.
- Short look-back periods (5 to 30 days) exhibited the strongest risk-adjusted returns.
- The ensemble "Combo" model showed a solid overall profile with a Sortino ratio of 2.03, a Sharpe ratio of 1.58, a maximum drawdown of just 19% (compared to >80% for Bitcoin passive exposure), and an annualized alpha of 14%.
- Diversified strategies targeting the most liquid digital assets also demonstrated strong performance, with a diversified strategy targeting the top 20 cryptocurrencies yielding a net-of-fees Sharpe ratio of 1.57 and a maximum drawdown of 11%.
